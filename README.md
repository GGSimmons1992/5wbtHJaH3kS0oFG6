# ValueInvestor

## Background:

We are a portfolio investment company and we make investments in the emerging markets around the world. Our company profits by investing in profitable companies, buying, holding and selling company stocks based on value investing principles.

Our goal is to establish a robust intelligent system to aid our value investing efforts using stock market data. We make investment decisions and based on intrinsic value of companies and do not trade on the basis of daily market volatility. Our profit realization strategy typically involves weekly, monthly and quarterly performance of stocks we buy or hold.
